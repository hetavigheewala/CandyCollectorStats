# CandyCollectorStats

This Python code tracks the number of candies collected by students and calculates relevant statistics. It repeatedly prompts the user to input the number of candies collected by a student until the user enters "1000," which terminates the process. It then calculates and displays the total number of candies collected by all students and the count of students who collected more than 4 candies. The code provides insight into candy distribution among students, helping to analyze and summarize the data.
